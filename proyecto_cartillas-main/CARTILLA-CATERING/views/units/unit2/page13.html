                        <B>A.</B>The kitchen is now the 'hub' of the house. The family, friends and visitors when waiting for a meal to be prepared all gather in the kitchen and help to prepare the dishes or watch others doing the cooking. The utensils available
                        to aid the food preparation are plentiful. Different types of knives for example. Aprons and oven gloves help to protect us from spills and heat when taking hot dishes from the oven. Some people love cooking, planning the meal,
                        assembling the ingredients and then preparing the food. Others however prefer to open a tin of food and hot up the contents.</li>
                    <li><b>B.</b>Before people had electricity and gas, they cooked on wood and charcoal fires. A fairly recent addition to cooking is the microwave. This speeds up the cooking time. Fan ovens are also more efficient. Barbecue cooking outside
                        in the garden on a warm day in summer, is very popular. In the kitchen, utensils are used to contain the food, and they vary from open pans to pans with lids, frying pans, steamers, pressure cookers and woks.</li>
                    <li><b>C.</b>Some foods can be digested raw but other foods are heated and cooked to make digestion faster. Salad leaves, cucumber, tomatoes, vegetables such as carrots, and fruit do not need cooking. However apples are an example of fruit
                        that can be eaten raw and also cooked. Stewed apples, apples baked in the oven and apples in pies and topped with crumble are ways of eating the fruit. When food is cooked, it is heated.</li>
                    <li><b>D.</b>There has been a great revival in the way food is cooked, mainly in part due to seeing a lot of cooking programs on television. These are often presented as competitions like Master Chef and the Great British bake-off. Also
                        people travel more to foreign countries and return home with exotic and interesting recipes. The availability of ingredients in the supermarkets also encourages experimentation.</li>
                    <li><b>E.</b>Before supermarkets sold ready cooked meals that just require re-heating, it was the tradition that men left the women in the home to prepare and cook food. Now both men and women share the tasks in well-designed kitchens.
                        In restaurants, the chef, a few years ago, was nearly always male. Today however, there are as many female chefs as men.</li>
