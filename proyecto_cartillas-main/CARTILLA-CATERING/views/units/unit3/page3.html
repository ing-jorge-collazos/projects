                    Kitchen staff teams depend on the type and size of a restaurant. 
                    <br><strong> The Executive chef </strong>is the most senior-level kitchen staff role. This person has a management role and oversees the entire kitchen. They often focus on operations, marketing and public relations and are also responsible for planning the restaurant's menu.
                    <br><strong> The Chef de cuisine</strong> also known as the head chef, manages the entire kitchen. They supervise the kitchen staff and maintain kitchen operations. They work with suppliers, keep stock of items, keep track of costs, create menus and recipes, and train the staff.
                    <br><strong> The Sous chef de cuisine</strong> typically takes over management when the chef de cuisine is unavailable. They tend to work more closely with the other stations of the kitchen. They are as an intermediary between the chef de cuisine and the rest of the kitchen staff.
                    <br><strong> The Chef de partie</strong> is responsible for preparing the food in a specific station in the kitchen. The job title can change according to the specific station they work.
                    <br><strong> The Commis chef</strong> is the most junior-level chef in a kitchen staff. They work under the chef de partie in a specific station to learn that station well and fulfill any tasks assigned by their chef de partie.
                    <br><strong> The Kitchen porter </strong>is also the kitchen assistant or hand. They are responsible for miscellaneous basic tasks like cleaning the food prep area, rinsing salad greens or peeling vegetables.
                    <br><strong> The Dishwasher </strong>cleans plates and cutlery and keeps the kitchen sanitary.
