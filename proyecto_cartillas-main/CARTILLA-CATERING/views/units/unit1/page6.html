                    Have you ever been on a social event such as a wedding, a graduation party, a fifteenth celebration, and wondered who the people behind everything are? If so, there is a big group of people who work extremely hard behind the things you enjoy on a social event, and sometimes they are not too well thanked at all. A global trend that is currently growing in the food-service industry. Social and business events and people’s love of eating out and shows has created a great chance for off-premises caterers to gain a profit in the catering market. In recent years, this market has had the biggest growth over other industries that deal with costumers in social events. People nowadays prefer to pay for a full food service rather than preparing their own food to offer either in a family celebration or a company’s important event. Catering brings to all of these costumers the chance to enjoy a party, a meeting, a celebration, or a big event without not worrying about serving food, timelines, washing all the crockery needed to elaborate special dishes, and becoming an octopus just to have everything in control when the celebration starts. All in all, the catering industry has become one of the most profitable business among social and business events that involves food service. Imagine you want to start your own catering firm. It could be a great challenge, yet if you love being behind a big staff of collaborators to make an event has a happy ending, this is the kind of market you will enjoy for sure.
